# WhatsApp Chatbot with OpenAI and Twilio

This is a simple WhatsApp chatbot that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API to generate responses to user messages through Twilio's WhatsApp integration.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- A Twilio account with WhatsApp capabilities
- An OpenAI API key
- A Railway account (for deployment)

## Local Development Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Fill in your credentials in the `.env` file:
   - TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID: Your Twilio Account SID
   - TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN: Your Twilio Auth Token
   - OPENAI_API_KEY: Your OpenAI API key

5. Start the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
6. Use ngrok to create a public URL:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 5000
   ```
7. Configure your Twilio WhatsApp webhook:
   - Go to your Twilio Console
   - Navigate to WhatsApp > Settings
   - Set the webhook URL to your ngrok URL + "/webhook" (e.g., https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/webhook)

## Railway Deployment

1. Create a new project on Railway.app
2. Connect your GitHub repository to Railway
3. Add the following environment variables in Railway's dashboard:
   - TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
   - TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
   - OPENAI_API_KEY
4. Railway will automatically detect the Python project and deploy it
5. Once deployed, Railway will provide you with a URL
6. Update your Twilio WhatsApp webhook URL to your Railway URL + "/webhook"
   (e.g., https://your-app-name.railway.app/webhook)

## Usage

1. Send a message to your Twilio WhatsApp number
2. The bot will process your message using OpenAI's API
3. You'll receive a response generated by the AI
